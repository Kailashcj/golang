/*
Changing a character in a string #
Strings are immutable. This means when str denotes a string then str[index] cannot be the left side of an assignment:
str[i] = 'D'   
Where i is a valid index, it gives the error cannot assign to str[i].

To change a character, you first have to convert the string to an array of bytes. 
Then, an array-item of a certain index can be changed, and the array must be converted back to a new string.
